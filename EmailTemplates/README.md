# Email-Templates
I was try to create a email and since we can add html content and make the email look great. the html output was completely screwed up and then figured out that many things do not work as it is if we use HTML in Email Body, Therefore i found an online Email Template and did some basic changes and kept it for later use.
Any one can use it now.
